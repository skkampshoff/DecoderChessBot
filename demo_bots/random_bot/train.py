# This is just a placeholder
# Your implementation of the chess bot
# may or may not require a training script
# in any case, train() should be implemented if you
# are using the __main__.py which was provided,
# or your bot must otherwise gracefully handle the "train"
# command line option to avoid running into errors as we
# systematically run each bot with the "train" option
# prior to the tourney
